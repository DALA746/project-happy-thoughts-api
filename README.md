- Your API should implement the routes exactly as documented above.
- Your `GET /thoughts` endpoint should only return 20 results, ordered by `createdAt` in descending order.
- Your API should validate user input and return appropriate errors if the input is invalid.
- In the `POST /thoughts` endpoint to create a new thought, if the input was invalid and the API is returning errors, it should set the response status to `400` (bad request).
- The endpoint to add hearts to a thought should return an appropriate error if the thought was not found.
